# HACKLAHOMA2022
## Inspiration
Our team initially wanted to create some form of blog, which was an idea from a list of recommended hackathon projects. We did not arrive at the event with an idea in mind, so it took us considerable time to discuss possible options. We debated the scope of possible features and created design mockups. Eventually, we agreed that a simple web app with an audio-focused scheme would be a unique project, and feasible given the time constraints.
## What it does
Our website presents the user with a list of submissions. An upload button opens a prompt that allows a user to upload their own audio file, an accompanying image file, a title, and tags. 
## How we built it
The website was developed in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We used a shared GitHub repository for version control and file sharing. We opted to use Cloud Functions on the Google Cloud Platform to host the web app.
## Challenges we ran into
Implementing a filter tool was more challenging than expected. It required the program to lift component properties to a higher level component. We had some trouble delegating tasks, since each team member had different skill sets and approaches to tasks. We also were challenged by the time constraint, since a lot of time was spent identifying the specifics of our project idea.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to create and deploy a functioning website. We gained a greater understanding of working with specific web elements and functionalities. Attending the event overnight in person also took some stamina and resolve, which we are proud of.
## What we learned
Our team gained insight into the intricacies of web development. We developed our skills working with React, HTML/CSS, and were able to improve our abilities to collaborate in a team environment.
## What's next for AudioOffice
We would like to improve the user interface for the website. We could also establish a server backend, allowing for users have unique user profiles. We can also optimize the performance of the website, and even explore monetization options.
